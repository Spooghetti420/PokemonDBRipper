# PokemonDB Ripper
A tool for extracting all pokeﾌ［on data and front-and-back sprites up to Generation 4. In collaboration with another developer creating a custom Pokeﾌ［on game requiring these assets.

## Usage
There are no dependencies, so you can run this program so long as you have a suitable version of Python 3:

`$ python scraper.py`

## Extension
If you desire all pokeﾌ［on generations, and not just up to 4, you can remove the line that breaks the iteration upon reaching Arceus (the highest registered Gen-4 pokeﾌ［on). The script is deliberately left simplistic, but can easily be modified to include alternative image sources to Platinum and subsume versions beyond just Generation 4 and below.

Please do not question the dubious "placeholder" item at the end of each line.)_
